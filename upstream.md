#Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words
---------------------------------------------------------------
When a repository is cloned, it has a default remote called origin that points to your fork on GitHub.
To keep track of the original repository, you need to add another remote named upstream. git remote add upstream <URL> assigns the original repository to a remote called 'upstream'.
