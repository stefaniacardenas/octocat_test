Within a repository you can create branches. A branch is a diversion from your master branch. Branches let you work on multiple disparate features at once. Git allows you to track all the changes and commit you make to a project. If you decide that you want to amend something you can go back in time and make a change. You can also decide to start a new branch, which can be compared to a sort of parallel universe, a new timeline where you can explore other possibilities without having an impact on present (your master branch). Your branches will have an ancestor commit in your repository, and will diverge from that commit with your changes. You can later merge your branch changes with your master branch.  Branches may be useful if you or other collaborators are working on a new feature together.
