You use git clone to get a local copy of a Git repository so you can look at it or you can modify it. Git clone will copy the entire history of the project on your computer, so you can have it locally and you can start working on it and edit the code. Git clone will create a copy of the main branch and in git subdirectory you will find all the data of the project.
