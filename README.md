#Octocat Test
===============

This is my week-2 test at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/‎)

Tasks
-------

*Part 1*
* Create a new repository on Github to store a list of test questions for this test. Choose the name appropriately
* Clone it locally into your dev folder making sure you don't get unnecessary double nesting, e.g. ~/projects/repo_name/repo_name/repo_files
* Create one file for each of the following questions on the master branch. Put each question (not answer) in its own file.
* Explain what git clone does, in your own words
* Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words
* Explain what a branch is, in your own words
* Do a commit after you create each file
* Create a new branch "answers"
* Update the files, replacing the questions with answers.
* Do a commit after you write each answer
* Make sure both branches are pushed back to github

*Part 2* 

*You may need to consult the official documentation (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). We haven't covered forking yet, please use the documentation.*
